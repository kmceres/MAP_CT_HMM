## Python scripts
This direcory contains all scripts needed to run models, conduct the initialzation paramter sensitivity analysis (sensitivity_analysis.py), calculate bootstrap confidence intervals (bootstrap_CI.py), and run the diagnostic algorithm (test.sa and sim_hmm.py) to determine the utility of the hmm in predicting cow progression path. 

## R scripts
This directory contains the files necessary to process data, and produce plots.

## Data
This directory contains all data necessary to run the models and produce all figures and tables. The data is organized by figure and table.
